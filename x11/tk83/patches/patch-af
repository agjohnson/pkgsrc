Tk uses X event numbers to index this array, as well as adding a few of its
own, starting with "VirtualEvent" (Which is correctly set to LASTEvent,
defined in include/X11/X.h).  In xproto-7.0.13, a new event "GenericEvent" was
added - making the array broken for all of Tk's internal events.

A cleaner fix, but a much bigger patch, is listed in the Tk bug tracker:
