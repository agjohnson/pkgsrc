In order to get the GNOME Desktop running properly, you need to follow
these manual steps:

1) Enable the system dbus daemon.  In order to do that, copy the
   ${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d/dbus script to /etc/rc.d and add
   dbus=YES to your /etc/rc.conf file.

2) Enable the hal daemon if GNOME has been built with the hal option (the
   default).  In order to do that, copy the ${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d/hal
   script to /etc/rc.d and set hal=YES in your /etc/rc.conf file.

3) Enable the cups daemon if you installed it.  In order to do that, copy
   the ${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d/{cupsd,slpd} scripts to /etc/rc.d and
   set cupsd=YES and slpd=NO in your /etc/rc.conf file.

4) Set up the gnome-screensaver PAM service by creating the
   /etc/pam.d/gnome-screensaver file.  You can use one of the files
   in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/gnome-screensaver/pam.d as templates.

5) Optionally enable the Avahi DNS Service Discovery service if you
   installed it.  In order to do that, copy the
   ${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d/avahidaemon script to /etc/rc.d and set
   avahidaemon=YES in your /etc/rc.conf file.

6) Optionally enable GDM (highly recommended).  Just copy the
   ${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d/gdm script to /etc/rc.d and add
   gdm=YES to your /etc/rc.conf file.
