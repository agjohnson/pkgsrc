This package supplies the user files necessary for full compatibility with
dynamically linked executables compiled under NetBSD 1.1 and earlier
releases.  You still need the options COMPAT_11 and COMPAT_12 in your
kernel configuration (and probably others; see options(4) for more
information) to make use of NetBSD 1.1 binaries.
