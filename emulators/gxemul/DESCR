GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation.
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented.
It is working well enough to allow unmodified "guest" operating systems to
run inside the emulator, as if they were running on real hardware.

The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may
consist of ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port
controllers.

GXemul, including the dynamic translation system, is implemented in
portable C, which means that the emulator will run on practically any host
architecture.

The documentation lists the machines and guest operating systems that can
be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best working guest operating
systems are probably NetBSD/pmax and NetBSD/cats.
