The CD Database Server (cddbd) is a program designed to allow remote
access of xmcd-style Compact Disc database entries via the Internet.
Many CD players (such as xmcd--another FreeBSD port, and DiscPlay
for Windows) can connect to this server through the Internet and
download CD data from the server machine's CDDB.

Current on-line information on cddbd can be found on the World
Wide Web page with the following URL:
